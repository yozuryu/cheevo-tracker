# Backlog.md Task Tracking for Agents

Task tracking system optimized for agent workflows via Backlog.md CLI.

## Three Primary Use Cases

### 1. Implementer: Deferring Issues During Feature Work
File P2-P4 issues discovered during implementation. Use label `remediation` for deferred review findings.
- **Create with plan**: You have implementation context at filing time
- **Assign priority**: See priority guide
- **Add type label** (required) + **app labels** (optional)

### 2. Reviewer: Audit Findings
Create structured issues from security/audit reviews. Link dependencies and assign to milestones.
- **Create with plan**: You're creating from audit context
- **Link dependencies** as needed
- **Assign priority**: Ask user if uncertain (label `priority-review`)
- **Set milestones**

### 3. Worker: Executing Assigned Tasks
Read task fully, understand all fields, follow acceptance criteria and definition of done.
- **Claim task**: `backlog task edit 42 -s "In Progress" -a @myself`
- **Read everything**: All fields, attached files/URLs, linked documentation
- **Complete systematically**: AC → Implementation Notes → Final Summary → DoD → Done

## Absolute Rules

1. **CLI only for writes**. `backlog task edit` and `backlog task create` only. Never edit files directly.
2. **Always use `--plain` flag** when reading: `backlog task 42 --plain`, `backlog task list --plain`
3. **Type label required** (bug|feature|documentation|refactor|remediation), single value only
4. **App labels optional**, can be multiple: synapse-pingora, signal-horizon-ui, signal-horizon-api, etc.
5. **Custom labels allowed** as agent-useful (priority-review, performance, security, etc.)

## Implementation Plans: When Required

| Scenario | Include Plan? | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Deferred review issues | ✅ YES | You have audit/review context now |
| Reporting found issues | ❌ NO | Implementer will plan when they work it |
| Explicitly asked to plan work | ✅ YES (detailed) | Required per instruction |
| Regular task work | After claiming, before coding | Don't add at creation, add after starting |

**Never update an existing plan unless explicitly instructed.**

## Priority System (See references/priority-labels.md for details)

- **P0**: Critical problems, major breakage
- **P1**: Legitimate bugs impacting users
- **P2**: Bugs, edge cases
- **P3**: Nice-to-have improvements, features we want
- **P4**: Backlog, future ideas

Unsure about P0-P1? Label with `priority-review` and let user decide.

## Task Completion Checklist

1. Status: "In Progress" + assign self
2. Read: All fields, attached documentation
3. Plan: Add implementation plan (if not deferred from review)
4. Work: Code implementation, mark AC as you complete each
5. Notes: Append progress notes as you go
6. Summary: Add final summary (PR-style)
7. DoD: Check all definition-of-done items
8. Done: Set status "Done"

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Create issue (required: title, type label, priority)
backlog task create "Title" -d "Description" -l bug -p 2 --ac "AC 1"

# Work a task
backlog task edit 42 -s "In Progress" -a @myself
backlog task 42 --plain              # Read everything
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1    # Mark AC complete
backlog task edit 42 --append-notes "Progress here"
backlog task edit 42 --final-summary "PR description"
backlog task edit 42 -s Done

# Search and filter
backlog task list -s "To Do" --plain
backlog search "topic" --plain
```
