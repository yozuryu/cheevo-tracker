# Changelog

## v26.04.12 — Watchlist & Mobile Polish

### RetroAchievements

- Watchlist: removed obsolete "Series" grouping option (no `series.json`, always produced empty results)
- Watchlist: console column now visible on mobile in "None" grouping; "Status" grouping shows console as subtitle under the title instead
- Watchlist: mastered progress cell now shows `X/Y` achievement count instead of a "Mastered" badge — status label below the title already conveys mastery
- Watchlist: skeleton persists until `BACKLOG.games` is populated, preventing empty-table flash when `watchlistData` arrives but `transformData` hasn't re-run yet

## v26.04.11 — Initial Release

Initial release — forked from gaming-hub and rebuilt as a standalone RA-only personal profile tracker with browser-side auth and live RetroAchievements API fetching.

### Auth

- New login screen (`/index.html` + `/login.js`): username + API key form with show/hide toggle; validates credentials against the RA API before storing
- Credentials stored in `localStorage` as `raCredentials = { username, apiKey }` — sent directly to RetroAchievements, never to any intermediary
- Profile page guards on mount: missing or invalid credentials redirect immediately to the login screen
- Auth errors (RA API 401 / `AUTH_ERROR`) call `clearCredentials()` and redirect to `/` from anywhere in the app
- Logout button in the topbar calls `clearCredentials()` and redirects to `/`
- How-to instructions for obtaining an API key shown inline on the login form (Settings → Keys → Web API Key)

### RetroAchievements

- All profile data fetched live from `https://retroachievements.org/API/` — no static JSON pipeline required
- Initial page load fires 5 parallel requests: `GetUserProfile`, `GetUserSummary`, `GetUserCompletionProgress` (paginated), `GetUserAwards`, and first `GetAchievementsEarnedBetween` chunk
- Achievement history fetches 2 chunks of 6 months eagerly on Activity tab open; heatmap updates as each chunk arrives
- Watchlist skeleton now persists until `transformData` has populated `BACKLOG.games`, preventing an empty-table flash between data arrival and render
- Heatmap computed client-side from loaded chunks via `useMemo` — no pre-built file needed
- Watchlist lazy-loads when the Watchlist tab is first opened
- Per-game achievement details (`GetGameInfoAndUserProgress`) fetched on first modal open, cached in `detailedGameProgress`; modal opens immediately with shimmer skeleton and updates live when data arrives
- `points7Days` and `points30Days` pre-computed from chunk 0 on initial load so stats show correct values immediately

### Structure

- Removed Steam profile, Activity, Completions, Hub landing, and Admin pages — RA profile is now the entire app
- RA profile moved from `/profile/ra/` to `/profile/`; root `/` serves the login page
- `profile/utils/ra-api.js` added as the RA API client: PascalCase → camelCase mapping so `transform.js` is preserved unchanged
- Mobile nav simplified to 2 tabs: Profile (`/profile/`) and Log (`/changelog/`)
- Service worker updated: cache name `cheevo-tracker-v1`, cross-origin RA API requests pass through without caching
- `manifest.json` updated: name "Cheevo Tracker", scope `"./"`
- `package.json` stripped to single `"start": "npx serve ."` script with no dependencies
